## **Fellowship of Heroes**

*"Explore challenging dungeons, complete dangerous quests and face insurmountable odds with your ragtag team of adventurers, all the while gathering precious resources to build and expand your home away from home - your very own settlement!*

*Plan an ever-growing community by constructing buildings with different functions and hiring skilled hunters, blacksmiths and much more. Manage their resource production and turn a profit by sending your traders to sell extra materials to nearby towns. Convince other characters to join your ambitious camp, appoint leaders and take advantage of the bonuses they bring.*

*But beware: no place is ever safe in the fantastical world of Dungeons and Dragons! Fight off packs of wolves that threaten your food stocks, build defensive fortifications to fend off greedy goblin attacks and heed any sign of conspiracies brewing amidst your fellow residents…*

*Slay, gather, defend, build! Lead by example your Fellowship of Heroes!"*

- *Fellowship of Heroes* is a prototype expansion for the tabletop game ["Dungeons & Dragons", by Wizards of the Coast](https://dnd.wizards.com/), and it is grounded on the concept of implementing base building and resource management mechanics.
