## **Motivation**

*"Explore challenging dungeons, complete dangerous quests and face insurmountable odds with your ragtag team of adventurers, all the while gathering precious resources to build and expand your home away from home - your very own settlement!*

*Plan an ever-growing community by constructing buildings with different functions and hiring skilled hunters, blacksmiths and much more. Manage their resource production and turn a profit by sending your traders to sell extra materials to nearby towns. Convince other characters to join your ambitious camp, appoint leaders and take advantage of the bonuses they bring.*

*But beware: no place is ever safe in the fantastical world of Dungeons and Dragons! Fight off packs of wolves that threaten your food stocks, build defensive fortifications to fend off greedy goblin attacks and heed any sign of conspiracies brewing amidst your fellow residents…*

*Slay, gather, defend, build! Lead by example your **Fellowship of Heroes**!"*


## **Introduction**

*Fellowship of Heroes* is tabletop, fantasy, role-playing prototype expansion for ["Dungeons & Dragons", by Wizards of the Coast](https://dnd.wizards.com/).

In *Fellowship of Heroes*, a group of 2-6 players (plus a dungeon master) take on the roles of adventurers who must face a challenging campaign full of unexpected quests and mighty enemies, whilst getting a foothold on the dangerous island of Skalus by building a settlement they can call their own.

Aside from the typical dungeon-crawling gameplay, the party of players are expected to develop their base camp by building structures with different benefits, upgrading them, defending them from enemies, selling excess materials and convincing characters they meet along the way to join their settlement.

This expansion aims to allow a group of players to experience first-hand what it means to build a thriving, living community inside an immersive fictional world, complemented by gameplay mechanisms that hook the players and motivate long-term investment.

- [A Ride to Skalus](https://github.com/zorrocrisis/FellowshipOfHeroes/blob/main/Full%20Expansion/Main%20Story%20-%20A%20Ride%20to%20Skalus.pdf), the story guide which functions as the main tool of the Dungeon Master;
- [The Ruleset](https://github.com/zorrocrisis/FellowshipOfHeroes/blob/main/Full%20Expansion/Ruleset.pdf), which holds the main rules and auxiliary tables for the base-building content of the game;
- [The Settlement Sheet](https://github.com/zorrocrisis/FellowshipOfHeroes/blob/main/Full%20Expansion/Settlement%20Sheet.pdf), which allows the players to keep track of structures built and upgrades implemented in their settlement;
- [The Character Sheets](https://github.com/zorrocrisis/FellowshipOfHeroes/tree/main/Full%20Expansion/Characters), which have all the information related to three different playable characters (although player can play their own characters);

## **Development Details**

- This project encompassed the final evaluation component of the 2022/2023 edition of the Game Design course of Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon, having the goal of relaying the **importance of increasingly detailed game design documentation.**

- *Fellowship of Heroes* was initially presented in a [High Concept](https://github.com/zorrocrisis/FellowshipOfHeroes/blob/main/High%20Concept.pdf) document, which briefly explores relevant game design topics such as general core features, player motivation, unique selling points, target audience and design goals.

- Then, a complete [Game Treatment](https://github.com/zorrocrisis/FellowshipOfHeroes/blob/main/Game%20Treatment.pdf) document was developed as the expansion's physical prototype came to life. This document further explored the aforementioned topics, delving deeper into the target audience, with reference to the Demographic Game Design 1 (DGD1) model, the core gameplay loop, the experience, the progression, the player interaction and the surrounding fiction.

- Aside from a cardboard platform which served as the base-building area, multiple paper pieces (e.g.: buildings, rivers and resource stockpiles) were printed to prototype and fine-tune the expansion through user testing. The feedback from these user testing sessions was promptly implemented into the game [Game Treatment](https://github.com/zorrocrisis/FellowshipOfHeroes/blob/main/Game%20Treatment.pdf) document.
